# DIVE-2278 — the veto principal is redacted AT GENERATION, not per-file.
#
# Council output (roster / init summary / veto-exercise line) is quoted verbatim into
# transcripts and posts. A raw Telegram user id printed there reaches a published artifact
# by default, and redacting one artifact leaves the generator emitting it into the next.
#
# This test pins the display filter itself (not a file's contents):
#   1. a tg:<digits> principal NEVER renders as those digits
#   2. the rendered label is stable and non-empty
#   3. human:<agent> passes through untouched (it is already a name)
#   4. every human-readable veto emitter routes through the filter (shape assertion, so a
#      NEW emitter added later without the filter fails here rather than in a transcript)
#
# Mutation grade: delete the tg:* arm of _council_principal_label and 1 goes red; drop the
# filter from any of the three echo lines and 4 goes red.
