# TIER: nightly — council e2e family trim (DIVE-4465) — tests/council_ballot_e2e.sh stays in core as the family's PR smoke; registry mode is graded nightly.
# DIVE-3729 — the bench registry must stay READABLE, and an unreadable one must SAY SO.
#
# What broke: the motion path persists the new roster with `mktemp` + `mv`. `mv` replaces the
# destination INODE, so benches.json inherited the temp file's 0600 root:root instead of its own
# 0644 root:claude, and every non-root seat was locked out from that moment. It was invisible
# because loadRegistry() failed OPEN (`catch { return {} }`) into resolveBench(), which fails
# CLOSED — so an EACCES surfaced as `unknown bench: <name>`, and a name that IS a built-in did not
# surface at all: it silently resolved to the genesis default, voiding a sealed motion for 5 weeks.
#
# THREE arms, and each names its own limit:
#   A. READER (real surface, built binary): an unreadable registry must be a loud read failure on
#      `bench ls`/`bench show`, NOT an empty registry and NOT a silent built-in fallback.
#      Needs a non-root euid — root reads a 0000 file, so the arm cannot fire as root and SKIPs.
#   B. JS WRITER (real surface): `bench add` must not leave the registry root-only, and must not
#      downgrade the mode of a registry that already exists.
#   D. RECEIPT/VETO DROP (real convene, end to end): the third gap the filer appended to this row —
#      the receipt write and the founder-veto ping share ONE `-w` guard with no else, so an
#      unprivileged scheduled convene sealed a digest, stored no receipt and never offered the veto,
#      silently. Needs a reachable seal (`sudo -n 5dive gate-proof sign`); SKIPs by name without one.
#   C. SHELL WRITER (property + negative control): the motion rewrite itself needs root AND a
#      gate-proof seal, so it is NOT driven here. What IS driven is the staged-replace pattern the
#      fix installs, against the pre-fix `mktemp`+`mv` form as the negative control — plus a guard
#      on the SHIPPED bundle that the motion path actually uses that pattern. That guard is what
#      ties arm C to the caller; without it this arm would grade the instrument, not the product.
