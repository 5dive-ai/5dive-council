# DIVE-1494 (1) bash e2e — the read-only convene NOTICE wiring. Drives the real
# `5dive council {init,convene}` bundle against an isolated STATE_DIR and asserts the notice:
#   (a) fires when COUNCIL_NOTIFY is set, carrying the disposition + tally (aA/rR/eE) + receipt,
#   (b) carries NO raw nonce / bearer token (read-only — distinct from the founder veto ping),
#   (c) stays SILENT when COUNCIL_NOTIFY is unset (opt-in).
# Offline via the MOCK + COUNCIL_NOTIFY_SINK seam (double-gated, mirrors COUNCIL_VETO_NONCE_SINK) so
# PRODUCTION never writes the sink and delivers solely via the guarded-optional `_tg_send` seam.
#
# Needs root (the convene seal runs in-process against the isolated STATE_DIR). Re-execs under
# passwordless sudo when available; SKIPs (green) otherwise — same posture as council_veto_e2e.sh.

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
