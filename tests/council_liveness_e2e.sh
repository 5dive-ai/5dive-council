# DIVE-1739 liveness E2E — proves the FULL-QUORUM (constitutional) liveness pre-check is REACHABLE
# through the real bash dispatcher (council/bin/council -> cli.mjs) on the BUILT ./5dive binary, the
# surface an amend/convene actually invokes. Gate answer A: a constitutional motion with any
# unreachable (asleep/deaf) seat REFUSES to dispatch and escalates (never inquorate-gambles 6/6); an
# ordinary-class motion is NOT gated. A FAKE `5dive` at COUNCIL_5DIVE_BIN stands in for the fleet
# (agent list health / agent send / task add|show). SKIPs green when node/jq missing or build fails.
# Exit 0 == green.

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
