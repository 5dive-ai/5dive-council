// DIVE-2891 unit — WHICH SILENCE WAS IT? Under `quorum: all` + `require_quorum: true` an abstention
// is a SILENT VETO, so a seat that could not answer and a seat that withheld consent must stop
// producing the same record. Until this change they did: both landed on `no vote by deadline` with
// no field on the sealed receipt able to separate them.
//
// Proven live 2026-08-07: codex's ballot went in_progress -> todo at ~10:40Z with 32 minutes left
// while `5dive agent info codex` reported active/enabled; the quota lock existed ONLY in a tmux pane
// that happened to be read while the round was still open. At the deadline the receipt sealed a bare
// abstain. Five seats cast and agreed; the instrument could not collect the sixth, and the durable
// record could not say so.
//
// The fix is pure instrumentation (remedy (a) on the row): the collect loop ALREADY polls `task show`
// every tick and reads a status it only tested for done/cancelled. The transitions separate the cases
// at zero cost and with no pane-scraping. Quorum, tally and capture semantics are UNTOUCHED — graded
// explicitly below, because "it made the failure legible" would not be worth a receipt-format change
// if it also moved a count.
//
// Offline: no network, no `5dive` exec (injected _exec/_now/_sleep seams). Exit 0 == green.
