# CNCL-18 ballot E2E — proves the NON-BLOCKING ballot dispatch is REACHABLE and DEFAULT through the
# real BASH dispatcher (council/bin/council -> cli.mjs), driving the BUILT ./5dive binary (not `node
# cli.mjs` directly), the surface a convener actually invokes.
#
# It builds a throwaway ./5dive to a temp dir (BUILD_OUT, pure-bash + fast) so it GATES in CI too.
# No root/seal/live-fleet is needed: an ad-hoc panel (--seats) skips the genesis + veto legs, an
# unsealed receipt is a valid convene (exit 0), and a FAKE `5dive` at COUNCIL_5DIVE_BIN stands in
# for the fleet (agent list / task add / task show / agent ask). SKIPs green when node/jq are
# missing or the build fails. Exit 0 == green.

# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
