// DIVE-2103: an EMPTY convene round must be VISIBLE, never silently absorbed.
//
// The defect this guards: both existing guards read only the MERGED tally — quorum in
// countConveneVotes, and the DIVE-1869 outage-is-not-a-decision refusal — so a round that
// returned zero substantive votes escapes both. Measured n=2 on OPPOSITE rounds: 2026-07-20
// round 2 empty (a live approve/reject split ERASED, run went inquorate), and 2026-07-21 seq 1
// round 1 empty while the receipt still read `approve a3/r0/e0 conf=1 dissent=none`.
//
// MUTATION-GRADED (the VERIFY BY bar): arm D neutralises the detector and REQUIRES red. A test
// that only asserts the happy path cannot tell a working detector from a deleted one — which is
// the exact class (vacuous assertion) that made T9 pass on a timeout for its entire life.
