# NAME THE TREE YOU GRADE.  (DIVE-2211, split out of DIVE-1921.)
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.  Every harness in tests/ reads src/ from the WORKING
# TREE by relative path, so "21 passed, 0 failed" has always been a claim about
# whatever happened to be on disk, not about a commit.  A green log from a stale
# checkout and a green log from origin/main are byte-identical.  That is the
# whole class: an operation that succeeds against the WRONG TARGET is
# indistinguishable from one that succeeds against the right one -- no error, no
# empty result, and it hands you plausible content to reason about, which is
# worse than nothing because it feeds the next step.  dev's DIVE-2144 audit
# anchored to a checkout ~20 commits behind origin/main, read real well-formed
# bash, and recommended REMOVING a control that exists.
#
# The unifying predicate, which is what makes the audit finite rather than a
# standing instruction to be careful: THE OPERATION ACCEPTED A TARGET NOBODY
# NAMED AND DEFAULTED TO THE WRONG ONE.  Enumerate the operations in a control
# path that take a target you did not write down, and write it down.  That list
# terminates.
#
# WHY PRINT AND NOT CHECK.  An implicit target cannot be printed, because there
# is no expression for it -- so the print statement cannot be written without
# doing the resolution you had been letting default.  Checking demands you know
# which target is right AT THE MOMENT OF CHECKING; printing demands only that
# you stop letting it default.  Strictly weaker demand on the author, and it
# leaves evidence in the log.  It also deletes a moment of recall instead of
# relying on one: a control that must be RECALLED at the right instant is prose
# no matter where it is stored, and a successful read asks no question.
#
# This is deliberately NOT a gate.  A dirty or stale tree is the normal
# pre-commit case and must stay gradeable.  The property is only that no log can
# be SILENT about which tree it graded.
#
# THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO.  A check can pass, fail, or FAIL TO RUN, and the
# third is where this class re-enters through its own fix.  `git diff --quiet
# HEAD` exits nonzero both for "there is a difference" and for "I could not
# run", so a bare `|| dirty` asserts uncommitted work on the strength of a check
# that established nothing.  Flip the polarity to `&& echo CLEAN` and the same
# non-runnable check reports clean forever: same line, same bug, opposite blast
# radius.  So every branch below is explicit, and the unknown branch says out
# loud that it is asserting nothing.  The pattern is already in this repo --
# install.sh takes `resolve_gh_tag || true`, gets empty, and treats EMPTY AS ITS
# OWN THIRD BRANCH rather than defaulting either direction.
#
# WHY STDERR.  A harness's stdout can be its output contract.  A control that
# corrupts the thing it grades reds for the wrong reason, and a control that
# reds for the wrong reason is worse than no control because it reds often
# enough to feel real.  stderr is still the log in CI and in a terminal.
#
# WHY THE TREE IS RESOLVED FROM THIS FILE'S OWN PATH, not from $PWD.  Harnesses
# `cd` around; $PWD at source time is a target nobody named either.  The tree
# graded is the one the harness FILE lives in, and BASH_SOURCE is the only
# expression that says so.
