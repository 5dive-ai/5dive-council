# TIER: nightly — council e2e family trim (DIVE-4465) — tests/council_ballot_e2e.sh stays in core as the family's PR smoke; capture is graded nightly.
# DIVE-1869 e2e — a convene that could not REACH its seats must fail LOUD, not seal a receipt.
#
# Two failures found on the 2026-07-24 flagship demo, both proved here on the BUILT binary (not by
# calling cli.mjs directly — that was the CNCL-26 blind spot):
#
#   (1) convene run without the privileged delivery grant: every seat ballot failed on delivery,
#       each was recorded as a plain ABSTAIN, and the run produced a normal-looking
#       "Inquorate: 0 of N voted" verdict. A permissions outage was indistinguishable from a
#       legitimate unanimous abstention. Now: exit non-zero, name the seats, seal nothing.
#   (2) `sudo 5dive council ...` died with "needs node on PATH" because root's non-login PATH has
#       no nvm node. Now: node is located, and the pick is the NEWEST version (not the first glob).
#
# Offline: a stub `5dive` on COUNCIL_5DIVE_BIN stands in for the fleet; a stub `sudo` makes the
# delivery pre-flight deterministic regardless of the runner's real sudo rights. No root, no seal,
# no live board. Exit 0 == green.

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
