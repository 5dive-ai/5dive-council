# TIER: nightly — 13.6s measured (DIVE-2525): does not fit the 300s PR core; the nightly sweep runs it.
# CNCL-11 bash e2e — the GOVERNANCE SURFACE wiring (roster / log / verify / promote / demote),
# not just the node engine. Drives the real `5dive council {init,roster,promote,demote,log,verify}`
# bundle against an isolated STATE_DIR + a self-provisioned gate-proof key, and asserts the
# acceptance: a promote/demote runs as a convened motion whose receipt + resulting roster join the
# tamper-evident lineage; roster shows the live seats + threshold + veto holder + lineage head;
# recusal drops the subject; `verify` is green while the chain is intact and RED after a tampered,
# dropped, or reordered record. Offline: COUNCIL_MOCK (mock all-approve votes), no network/tasks.db.
#
# Needs root (the gate-proof seal runs in-process against the isolated STATE_DIR). Re-execs under
# passwordless sudo when available; SKIPs (green) otherwise — same posture as council_veto_e2e.sh.

# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.

# registry bench (benches.json .council.{genesis,seats}); once that bench lost its genesis marker it
# died "the Council has no genesis roster — seed it first" EVEN THOUGH the root-sealed lineage was
# intact (roster and log had diverged). The fix derives the roster from the lineage head, with the
# registry bench a fallback ONLY when no lineage record carries seats. Clear the bench genesis marker
# + seats while the intact 3-record chain stays untouched, and assert roster STILL resolves the 3
# lineage-head seats (main/olivia/codex, post-demote) and never emits the seed-it-first death.
