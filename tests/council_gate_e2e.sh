# TIER: nightly — 13.0s measured (DIVE-2525): does not fit the 300s PR core; the nightly sweep runs it.
# CNCL-12 bash e2e — the gate-rot WIRING (not just the pure mapper). Drives the real
# `5dive council {gate-clear,rot-triage}` bundle end-to-end against an isolated STATE_DIR +
# TASKS_DB + a self-provisioned gate-proof key, and asserts the three load-bearing legs the
# acceptance requires:
#   A) a genuine TIER-1 gate is CLEARED with a sealed receipt (task answer written by council),
#   B) a TIER-2 gate routed through gate-clear ESCALATES (guardrail) and is NEVER cleared,
#   C) a synthetic 48h-old TIER-2 gate through rot-triage is re-briefed and NEVER cleared.
# Offline: COUNCIL_MOCK (mock seat votes -> approve), no network, isolated tasks.db.
#
# Needs root (the convene's gate-proof seal runs in-process against the isolated STATE_DIR).
# Re-execs under passwordless sudo when available; SKIPs (green) otherwise — same posture as
# council_veto_e2e.sh, so CI never goes red on a runner that can't seal.

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
