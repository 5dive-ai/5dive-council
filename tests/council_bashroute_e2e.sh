# TIER: nightly — council e2e family trim (DIVE-4465) — see tests/council_ballot_e2e.sh, which stays in core as this family's PR smoke. Nightly runs this arm in full.
# CNCL-26 bash-route E2E — proves `5dive council sign-vote` / `verify-votes` are REACHABLE
# through the real BASH dispatcher (council/bin/council), not just via `node cli.mjs` directly.
#
# This closes the blind spot that let CNCL-10 ship a gap: the co-sign engine + cli routes were
# fully tested, but the bash allowlist in cmd_council() never routed sign-vote/verify-votes, so
# `5dive council sign-vote` died E_USAGE ("unknown council command"). Every CNCL-10 test drove
# `node "$CLI"` directly, so 5/5 CI stayed green while the SHELL surface — the one a seat actually
# invokes from its own harness during a dispatched convene — was dead. This harness drives the
# BUILT binary so the dispatcher IS the thing under test.
#
# It builds a throwaway ./5dive to a temp dir (build.sh is pure-bash + fast, honours BUILD_OUT) so
# it GATES in CI too (CI never builds ./5dive, and no root/sudo/seal is needed — these verbs are
# pure). SKIPs green only when node/jq/openssl are missing or the build fails. Exit 0 == green.

# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
