// that IS in BUILTINS does not miss at all: it silently resolved to the genesis default, so a
// quorum-carried, hash-chained, sealed motion was voided by a file mode for five weeks with no
// error on any path. A missing store and an unreadable one are different facts and only one of
// them is normal, so only ENOENT stays soft.
// DIVE-3729 iteration 2 (ops hold on #734): failing CLOSED on EACCES was right about the FACT and
// wrong about the BLAST RADIUS. The population that has an unreadable registry is exactly the
// legacy root-0600 fleet this fix exists to repair, so a hard `die` there converted a silent
// wrong-bench into `exit 2` on the working path — it took `council convene` DOWN on every host it
// was meant to save. The rule that survives both: a read failure must never be SILENT, but it must
// only be FATAL where continuing would destroy something. So —
//   1. try to REPAIR the mode we find (works when we are root or own it — which covers the
//      sudo-driven scheduled convene, i.e. the fleet's own self-heal); re-read and carry on.
//   2. where repair is impossible and the caller only READS, DEGRADE: return the empty registry the
//      old code returned, but hand the caller a loud, structured reason it must surface. Nothing is
//      lost that was not already lost; the difference from the original bug is that it is now SAID.
//   3. where the caller MUTATES (init, bench add/rm, schedule add/rm), stay FATAL — a
//      read-modify-write over a registry we could not read would delete every entry in it. That is
//      the one place the exit-2 is worth more than the convenience.
// `registryDegraded` is module-level so the command can put it on its OWN output envelope: it must
// not ride stderr, because `--json` callers capture 2>&1 and a stray line breaks their jq (the same

// DIVE-2889 — THE BALLOT MUST CARRY THE CANDIDATE, NOT A 12-CHAR PREFIX OF ITS DIGEST.
//
// MEASURED (olivia as chair, from dev's finding on DIVE-2887, re-measured before filing): the
// eng_approval_lead amendment was balloted TWICE on digest 6498adcb…, which RESOLVES TO NO FILE
// ANYWHERE ON DISK. Both approving rationales claimed a direct read of the on-disk content — and
// both statements were true about 8ee23dff… (the LIVE constitution), which is not what was
// balloted. Two seats ran a verification that silently resolved to the live file and got a
// CONFIRMATION instead of a finding. codex rejected both rounds on exactly this ground and was
// right both times; the inquorate failure is the only thing that stopped an unreviewed policy
// from sealing.
//
// THE SHARP DISTINCTION, and the reason no amount of seat diligence fixes this: "the candidate is
// unavailable" and "the candidate is available and fine" are THE SAME SENTENCE ONE DIGEST APART.
// A seat reading the ballot could not tell them apart, because the ballot named neither the path
// nor the full digest — and the precedent block propagates a prior VERDICT and its prose but NOT
// the digest that verdict was about, so case law cannot separate them either.
//
// TWO GUARDS, and the first is the one that matters:
//
//   1. THE DIGEST MUST BE THE DIGEST OF THE BYTES WE ARE BALLOTING. We already hold the candidate
//      text here (we just parsed it), so re-derive its sha256 and REFUSE on mismatch. This is what
//      makes 6498adcb… structurally unreachable: a digest that no longer corresponds to the bytes
//      at the named path cannot reach a seat at all. Fail closed at mint, per the row — "a motion
//      whose bytes cannot be located should not reach seats at all".
//   2. THE BALLOT CARRIES path + FULL digest + diff-vs-live. Not so a stale objection stops
//      recurring (that was the earlier, wrong framing, corrected on the wiki page) but so a seat's
//      `verify` CANNOT silently resolve to the live file: with the full digest in the row,
//      `sha256sum <path>` is a one-command binding rather than an eyeball comparison against a
//      truncated prefix, and a seat with no sibling row to read still has a route to the bytes.
//      Before this, both seats that went looking (DIVE-2882, DIVE-2886) had to locate the
//      candidate independently, and that it worked is not the same as it being delivered.
//
// WHY THE DIFF IS CAPPED: this question becomes the ballot BODY for human seats too, delivered as
// a Telegram message with a hard length limit — an uncapped diff would turn a governance change
// into a capture failure, which is the same fail-open in a new coat. So the cap is deliberate and
// the ballot always names the exact command for the full diff; the binding (path + full digest) is
// never truncated, because that is the part a seat cannot reconstruct.
// Sized against the transport, not against taste. The human-seat ballot body is
// `${question}` + a ~250-char tap suffix, and a PRECEDENT block (one line per prior decision) can
// precede the ask — all of it inside one Telegram message. Measured with a 400-line diff: 40
// lines / 1600 chars puts the whole question near ~1.9k, leaving ~2k of headroom. The binding
// itself is never counted against this cap; only the diff is clipped.
