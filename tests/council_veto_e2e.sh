# CNCL-9 bash e2e — the authenticated founder veto WIRING (not just the node engine). Drives the
# real `5dive council {init,convene,veto exercise,lineage verify}` bundle against an isolated
# STATE_DIR + a self-provisioned gate-proof key, and asserts the four legs main's hard gate
# required (2026-07-19): nonce-mismatch refused+logged, window-expiry refused, a real tap flipping
# pass->blocked inside a sealed receipt, and lineage-verify GREEN after the veto. Plus the security
# amendments: the receipt stores only the nonce DIGEST (never the raw bearer token), the pings
# audit is 0600, a forged `--veto-by` is refused+logged, and a tampered receipt canonical is
# refused (the re-seal hardening). Offline: COUNCIL_MOCK, no key/network/live tasks.db.
#
# Needs root (the gate-proof seal runs in-process against the isolated STATE_DIR). Re-execs under
# passwordless sudo when available; SKIPs (green) otherwise — same posture as the node-skip in
# council_unit.sh, so CI never goes red on a runner that can't seal.
