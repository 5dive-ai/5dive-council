# TIER: nightly — 9.9s measured (DIVE-2525): does not fit the 300s PR core; the nightly sweep runs it.
# CNCL-17 bash e2e — the seat TRACK RECORD wiring (not just the pure scorer). Drives the real
# `5dive council record` bundle end-to-end against an isolated STATE_DIR + TASKS_DB:
#   - seeds two decided tasks (one DONE → good outcome, one CANCELLED → bad outcome) + one still-open,
#   - drops sealed-shape receipts whose canonical carries `vote <seat>:` lines + a `subject` ident,
#   - asserts the scorer credits an approve on a good outcome, VINDICATES a dissent on a bad one,
#     and NEVER scores the still-open task (no eventual outcome).
# `council record` itself is read-only, but seeding the isolated tasks store needs `task init`
# (root). Re-execs under passwordless sudo when available; SKIPs (green) otherwise — same posture
# as council_gate_e2e.sh, so CI never reds on a runner that can't init. Offline.

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
