# DIVE-2257 — the founder-veto HOLD-WINDOW invariant, measured against the six offers that were
# actually recorded in /var/lib/5dive/council/veto-pings.jsonl.
#
# THE DEFECT: every veto offer ever sent advertised "Execution holds until <T>" with T already in
# the PAST at the moment of sending, so the founder veto has never once been exercisable.
#
# THE INVARIANT: `_council_veto_ping` refuses at WRITE time any offer whose executeAfter <= its own
# ts — no ledger row, no delivery on either leg, one auditable refusal row instead.
#
# HOW THE SIX ARE REPLAYED: an offer's window is the SIGNED OFFSET between its ts and the
# executeAfter it advertised (the absolute wall-clock date is not the defect — the offset is). Each
# recorded pair is replayed by re-basing its offset onto the write moment: executeAfter = now +
# (recorded_ea - recorded_ts). All six offsets are <= 0, so all six must be REFUSED.
#
# The harness runs the REAL extracted functions from the built council/bin/council (not a
# re-implementation), and is three-sided: the six-way replay must refuse, a genuine +900s window
# must still SEND, and a mutant with the window check neutered must let all six through (so a green
# replay cannot be vacuous).
#
# Offline: no key, no network, no live tasks.db, no root.
