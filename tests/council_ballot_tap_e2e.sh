# TIER: nightly — council e2e family trim (DIVE-4465) — tests/council_ballot_e2e.sh stays in core as the family's PR smoke; this tap enumeration is graded nightly.
# DIVE-1565 ballot-tap E2E — proves the human ballot TAP->task-close BRIDGE is REACHABLE through the
# real BASH dispatcher (council/bin/council -> cli.mjs), driving the BUILT ./5dive binary (not `node
# cli.mjs` directly), the surface the DIVE-1566 telegram plugin actually shells (CNCL-26 bash-route
# lesson: an .mjs-only test would miss an embed-drift break).
#
# It builds a throwaway ./5dive to a temp dir (BUILD_OUT, pure-bash + fast) so it GATES in CI too. A
# FAKE `5dive` at COUNCIL_5DIVE_BIN stands in for the board: `task ls --json` returns one OPEN human
# ballot whose body carries nonceDigest=sha256(NONCE); `task done` is logged. SKIPs green when node/
# jq/sha256sum are missing or the build fails. Exit 0 == green.

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
