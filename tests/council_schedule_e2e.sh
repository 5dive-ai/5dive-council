# TIER: nightly — 6.2s measured (DIVE-2525): does not fit the 300s PR core; the nightly sweep runs it.
# CNCL-23 schedule E2E — proves `5dive council schedule {add,ls,show,rm,run}` are REACHABLE
# through the real BASH dispatcher (council/bin/council) on the BUILT binary, and that the
# deterministic RUNNER generalizes the CNCL-21/22 ops scripts correctly:
#   - config CRUD round-trips (add -> ls -> show -> rm) with fail-closed on unknown,
#   - add emits the managed crontab line (tested with --no-cron so the harness NEVER mutates
#     a real user crontab) and does NOT install it,
#   - `run` parses `ACTION:` lines from the sealed verdict and files up to maxActions
#     `--from=council` board tasks (isolated TASKS_DB), citing the sealedDigest,
#   - an INQUORATE / FAILED envelope files NOTHING (CNCL-18 signal) and still exits 0,
#   - --dry prints the task-adds instead of filing.
# The convene itself is stubbed via SCHED_PARSE_TEST=<fixture envelope> (mirrors the ops
# scripts' STANDUP_PARSE_TEST) so the runner is exercised offline with zero network / no seat
# dispatch. Builds a throwaway ./5dive (BUILD_OUT) so it GATES in CI; SKIPs green if it can't
# build or node/jq are missing. Exit 0 == green.

# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
