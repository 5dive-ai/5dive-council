# TIER: nightly — 9.5s measured (DIVE-2525): does not fit the 300s PR core; the nightly sweep runs it.
# CNCL-15 bash e2e — CONSTITUTION AMENDMENTS wiring (real `5dive council {init,amend,convene,verify}`
# bundle against an isolated STATE_DIR + a self-provisioned gate-proof key). Asserts the acceptance:
#   (1) genesis seeds a v0 constitution.yaml and SEALS its digest into the genesis record;
#   (2) `council amend` runs as a constitutional-class motion — on a mock all-approve PASS the new
#       constitution is swapped on disk AND its digest is hash-chained into the lineage;
#   (3) drift FAILS CLOSED — a hand-edited constitution.yaml makes `verify` go RED and a primary-council
#       `convene` ESCALATE (forged governance is not enforced), and restoring the file re-greens it;
#   (4) an INVALID proposed constitution is refused before any convene.
# Offline: COUNCIL_MOCK (mock all-approve votes), no network / tasks.db. Needs root for the
# in-process gate-proof seal; re-execs under passwordless sudo, else SKIPs green (like the peers).

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
