// DIVE-1869 capture-failure unit — a seat we never REACHED is not a seat that abstained.
//
// The bug: convene dispatches each seat ballot over a rail that needs a privileged grant. Run
// without it, every dispatch failed instantly and was folded into a plain ABSTAIN, so the run
// produced a normal-looking "Inquorate: 0 of N voted" verdict and a clean sealed receipt. A
// permissions outage was byte-indistinguishable from a legitimate unanimous abstention.
//
// The contract proved here: capture failures are TAGGED through normalization, counted apart from
// real abstentions, and a convene whose non-votes are ALL capture failures is flagged
// `deliveryFailure` (the CLI refuses to emit or seal it). Offline, no exec. Exit 0 == green.
