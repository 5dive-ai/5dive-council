# DIVE-2889 — the amend BALLOT MINT must refuse a motion it cannot bind, and must carry the
# candidate's path + FULL digest + diff-vs-live into the ballot body.
#
# Incident: the eng_approval_lead amendment was balloted TWICE on digest 6498adcb…, which resolves
# to no file anywhere on disk, while both approving rationales claimed "I verified the on-disk
# content directly" — true statements about the LIVE constitution (8ee23dff…), which is not what
# was balloted. Two seats ran a verification that silently resolved to the live file and got a
# CONFIRMATION instead of a finding. codex rejected on exactly this ground both times and was right;
# only the inquorate failure stopped an unreviewed policy from sealing.
#
# The distinction the old ballot could not express: "the candidate is unavailable" and "the
# candidate is available and fine" are THE SAME SENTENCE ONE DIGEST APART — the ballot named neither
# path nor full digest, and the precedent block propagates a verdict's prose but not the digest it
# was about.
#
# Graded here, at the mint, offline (node + cli.mjs only — no council, no root, no network):
#   A. the digest balloted must BE the digest of the candidate's bytes (the 6498adcb shape)
#   B. a truncated digest is refused (a prefix is not a binding)
#   C. a candidate with no resolvable path is refused
#   D. the happy path carries path + FULL 64-hex digest + the one-command bind + the diff
#   E. an oversized diff is capped LOUDLY and still names the command for the whole of it
# Run: bash tests/council_amend_ballot_binding_unit.sh  (no root, no network).
