# TIER: nightly — council e2e family trim (DIVE-4465): six council e2e harnesses cost 24.8s of the 300s PR core for a product surface no merge or ship path runs. tests/council_ballot_e2e.sh stays in core as the family's PR-facing smoke; the enumerations move to the nightly sweep, which runs every one of them.
# DIVE-2890 roster PER-CLASS THRESHOLD e2e — proves `5dive council roster` reports the bar for the
# decision class a seat is actually voting in, not the default (`ordinary`) spec alone.
#
# The defect this guards: roster printed ONE unconditional line — "threshold: 4 to pass, quorum 4
# (spec: {"rule":"majority"})" — which is the ordinary rule. The constitutional class is 2/3 with
# quorum ALL and require_quorum:true, so on a 6-seat council roster under-reported quorum as 4 when
# it is 6. The direction is what makes it dangerous: it is wrong REASSURINGLY. A seat that runs
# roster mid-ballot to decide whether its vote still matters reads "quorum 4", sees 4 already cast,
# infers "we are quorate, mine is redundant", and abstains — which under require_quorum:true is the
# one action that inquorates the motion. The constitutional class had already failed INQUORATE twice
# (4/6 and 5/6) when this was filed. `--class=constitutional` was ALSO silently accepted and
# ignored, so the one flag that looks like it answers the question returned the wrong answer without
# erroring, and `--help` just re-printed the roster.
#
# Drives the BUILT binary (the bash surface a seat invokes), not `node cli.mjs`, because the whole
# defect lived in the bash print + arg handling. Seals genesis on the ROOT gate-proof rail into an
# isolated STATE_DIR — see the rail block below for which of the two rails each environment has.

# ================= THE SEAL RAIL, AND WHY THIS HARNESS RE-EXECS (DIVE-3282) =====================
# `council init` seals the genesis record on the ROOT gate-proof rail, and there are TWO ways to
# reach it (council/bin/council, _council_seal_stdin):
#   · IN-PROCESS, when we already are root.
#   · `sudo -n 5dive gate-proof sign` — resolved BY NAME off PATH, so it needs an INSTALLED
#     /usr/local/bin/5dive. Not the binary this harness built; the one on the box.
# This file shipped claiming "no root/sudo/seal needed", which was true of the ONE environment it
# was written on: the control-plane host grants NOPASSWD to /usr/local/bin/5dive and nothing else,
# so `sudo -n true` FAILS here while the by-name rail works. Neither CI probe environment installs
# that binary (full-sweep's installed-host job seeds /var/lib/5dive, the plugin stubs and the
# `claude` group — not the CLI), so on both runners the seal returned empty and the harness took
# its SKIP. A skip in one environment is not an accusation; this was a skip in EVERY environment,
# which harness-verdict-union reads as NEVER PROBED — it graded nothing, anywhere, and froze the
# release cut behind a corpus-wide invariant.
#
# So take whichever rail the environment actually has, and SKIP only when it has neither:
# re-exec under passwordless sudo when one exists (a runner has it; this host does not) and seal
# in-process, else fall through to the by-name rail. This is the peer idiom already carrying
# council_veto_e2e.sh and constitution_set_e2e.sh, not a new mechanism.
#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: build BEFORE the re-exec. build.sh runs `git rev-parse` in the checkout,
# and root reading a tree owned by another user (the runner's is owned by `runner`) trips git's
# dubious-ownership refusal — a rebuild on the far side of sudo would SKIP for a second reason.
# The already-built path travels across as _ROSTER_CLASS_E2E_TMP, which doubles as the re-exec
# guard: a `sudo` that returns 0 without conferring root must not loop.
